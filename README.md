I solved all of the except for 12 and 21.

12 i copied a provided solution from reddit.  I need to understand it...
21 i just didn't like this question. it required hacking the hidden empty row/column and then calculating
   the result, with a program for the edges.  

25 was amazing.  my solution is too slow though, ran for 10 hours. what is the fast solution?
